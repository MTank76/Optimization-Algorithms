# Optimization Algorithms 

This repository encompasses several optimization algorithms implemented in Python, offering solutions to various problem domains. The algorithms covered here include Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), and Minimax Algorithm.

## Algorithms Included

### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Description:** BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **Implementation:** The BFS algorithm has been applied to explore and traverse graphs efficiently.

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Description:** DFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **Implementation:** The DFS algorithm has been utilized for graph traversal and exploration purposes.

### 3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
- **Description:** TSP involves finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
- **Implementation:** The TSP algorithm has been implemented to solve optimization problems related to route planning and optimization.

### 4. Minimax Algorithm
- **Description:** Minimax is a decision-making algorithm used in game theory for minimizing the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.
- **Implementation:** The Minimax algorithm has been coded to make optimal decisions in game-related scenarios.
